### Day 12: [Rain Risk](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/12)

*Haskell: [Part 1](https://github.com/DestyNova/advent_of_code_2020/blob/main/day12/Part1.hs), [Part 2](https://github.com/DestyNova/advent_of_code_2020/blob/main/day12/Part1.hs)*

Much easier than many of the recent problems, the only difficulty was in handling the waypoint rotation in part 2, but that's helped by the fact that you can drop all the logic for managing ship orientation.
